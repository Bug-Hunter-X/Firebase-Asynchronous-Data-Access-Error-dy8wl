# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore: accessing data before the asynchronous query completes.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using async/await.

The error results in undefined or null values being retrieved, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.  The solution focuses on employing proper asynchronous techniques to ensure data is available before usage.
