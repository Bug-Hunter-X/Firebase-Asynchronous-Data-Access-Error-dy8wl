The issue lies in the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.  If you attempt to access data from a Firebase query before it has fully resolved, you'll receive undefined or null values. This often occurs when you're using `onSnapshot` or `get()` methods without proper error handling or asynchronous control flow mechanisms like promises or async/await.
